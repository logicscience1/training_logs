# training_logs
 tracking fitness

5k_training.py
appends new row to 5k_training.csv with date of run, time for each individual km run up to 5km, time and distance for anything over 5k, a code for the run and calculation of the average time per km during the 5k stage

codes are
L : lunchtime run, this is 5k with sprint intervals and a long downhill uphill bit with 10k weight vest
F : Friday night run, this is typically a 5k jog around the block wearking the 10k weight vest
Sa : Saturday run, this is typically a cycle to Gedling country park and 5k going up and down the hills, not weighted and cycle home.
Su : Sunday run, this is a long run, unweighted going as far as possible beyond 5k

future update:
automatically record the date if [enter] is pressed with no input

even better would be to program the whole csv output by directly reading the gps logs from the garmin.
